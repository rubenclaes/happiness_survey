|Acceptance Criteria|  By default, there is a client manager filter for each client manager in the dropdown list. These are predefined. In the mock-up, we defined only one for Wim. 
|     |After selecting the filter in the dropdown, the dropdown list closes again and the data changes immediately according to the filter.    
|     | Predefined segment filters cannot be removed or changed by the user. So, this means that the edit and delete icons will not be displayed.
